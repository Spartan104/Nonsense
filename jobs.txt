Lucas Haering
I will be the president of the United Earth Government.
I will then bring down upon the people of the land vast starvation and poverty, as I love the sight of suffering
civilians.
However, following an assasination attempt by Daniel Tolbert, I begins to search for all of the infinity stones to dessimate the 
population of those who resist me.
